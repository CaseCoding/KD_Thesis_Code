# KD_Thesis_Code
Repository to store coding related files for my under graduate thesis.

Because of github file upload limit, i have stored all .pkl files and raw dataset images inside a google drive folder.
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bUQlY5x_7kRKjjDlsojCeT2-h-TxHFyt?usp=sharing - Please go to this link to view the files.
In order to feed the data to our model, all data was one-hot-encoded and loaded into .pkl files using "one_hot_encoding.ipynb".

The file called "Knowledge distillation Tutorial.ipynb" is used as a basis for the main code. It has been adapted to fit the coding goal at hand and falls under a free-use license.
The file called "final_version_Thesis_KDmodels.py" is a python file used to train and test all 5 models discussed in the Thesis. When pickle files are loaded into the enviornment it should return identical results.

For visualizing the model results the "thesisresultsvisualization.ipynb" was used. This contains all outputs from testing still.
